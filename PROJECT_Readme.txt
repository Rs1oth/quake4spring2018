Assassin's Creed Quake Mode
Readme

This is a multiplayer quake 4 mod

1.)Set up a server as normal for quake 4, with a high value fraglimit (I suggest around 750 for an average length game)

2.)Gather weapons for kills

3.)Kill other player. Only killing other players give points and each weapon give different points per kill.
	(For know the NPCs do not behave like they should. They also do not look like player, however in a full release they should
	both move and look like players. Unlike now where one NPC follows you and the rest will run in a direction forever. 
	There is a bug where only one AI script is working at a time, once the NPC the script is controlling dies, 
	the next NPC will be controlled).
3.5) Weapons 
	Gauntlet : 		Hidden Blade : 	points 200
	Machinegun : 		Musket : 	points 75
	Shotgun : 		Blunderbuss :   points 50
	Hyperblaster : 		Fiat Lux (Smoke/Flash thing) : Cant kill with this
	Grenade Launcher : 	Satchel Charge (5s till explosion) : points 100
